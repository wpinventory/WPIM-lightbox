== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Q. It isn't working! Why aren't my images showing in a lightbox? =
Check the following items:
1. You have installed, and activated, and "turned on" WP Lightbox 2 plugin.
2. You have set the images to open in a new window (under "WP Inventory" => "Settings", "Images / Media" tab).

= Q. Help! My lightbox images are huge! =
Yes, this happens when the "full size" image you have uploaded is very large.  Thankfully we've built a setting in the
WP Inventory Settings (under "Image/Media", then "Lightbox Integration") which allows you to change the size of
the lightbox image.  Note that this does NOT have to be used in conjunction with lightboxes - you can turn off the
lightbox feature, but still control the image size!
